This is a fully functional blog developed with rails. A few commits have not been pushed for security purposes. 
However, a live view of the blog is at http://www.damainboss.com

Please note that this blog is only used to test out new gems and newly discovered ways of doing things

Contact damainboss@damainboss.com for any queries, which I doubt there would be any :D
